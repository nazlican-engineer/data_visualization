# **planet_dataset_analysis**
In my project, I first tried to understand the story behind the planet dataset. This dataset contains information such as the discovery dates of planets, the methods of their discovery, their masses, and their distances from the galaxy. The method column in the dataset is of type object and, since it is a nominal variable, it was not mandatory to convert it to category type. However, I converted it to category in order to make the analysis more understandable. I noticed that there were missing values in the dataset, so I filled them either with zero or with the mean of the corresponding column. After performing these steps, I used a barh chart based on the method categorical variable. I observed that the "Radial Velocity" method was used more frequently for planet discovery. When I researched the reason, I found that the "Radial Velocity" method is dominant in the dataset because it was developed earlier, has a wide range of applications, and is considered highly reliable.

# **diamonds_dataset_analysis**
In this project, I performed certain analyses on the diamonds dataset. The diamonds dataset provides information about different types of diamonds. Since variables like color, cut, and clarity are ordinal-type objects, I converted them to category type. I then visualized my analyses using various plots, such as histograms. For example, I found which price ranges diamonds appear most frequently in the dataset.

However, analyzing this dataset alone was not sufficient for me to interpret it correctly; therefore, I added the cut column as a hue (used to add a new category) parameter. Using this plot, I set the x-axis according to the minimum and maximum values I had previously found in the histogram. Based on my analyses, I can say that Ideal, the highest quality diamonds, are mostly concentrated in the $2000â€“$3000 range in my dataset. From this, I can conclude that in the market, high-quality but low-priced diamonds are more common.

# **tips_dataset_analysis**
The Tips dataset briefly shows how many customers visited a restaurant, on which days and during which time intervals, and how much tip they left. I used this dataset to perform analyses, particularly employing violin and boxplot plots. This allowed me to understand the purpose and use of these types of graphs.

I would like to explain one of my analyses: the boxplot graph. (Boxplots are especially important in machine learning to show whether a dataset contains outliers; they are also quite effective as they display the median.) I placed the days on the x-axis and the total bills on the y-axis. To see how much men and women paid during these time intervals, I categorized the data using the gender column. Based on my results, I can say that the average total bill paid by men is higher than that paid by women.
