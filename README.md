# **planet_dataset_analysis**
In my project, I first tried to understand the story behind the planet dataset. This dataset contains information such as the discovery dates of planets, the methods of their discovery, their masses, and their distances from the galaxy. The method column in the dataset is of type object and, since it is a nominal variable, it was not mandatory to convert it to category type. However, I converted it to category in order to make the analysis more understandable. I noticed that there were missing values in the dataset, so I filled them either with zero or with the mean of the corresponding column. After performing these steps, I used a barh chart based on the method categorical variable. I observed that the "Radial Velocity" method was used more frequently for planet discovery. When I researched the reason, I found that the "Radial Velocity" method is dominant in the dataset because it was developed earlier, has a wide range of applications, and is considered highly reliable.
